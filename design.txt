We want a collection of twitter hashtag trends by location (woe id)
Worldwide
 - #キスマイ10年
 - #CDTVライブライブ
 - #THEBOYZ_THESTEALER
 - #あなた役の声優オーディション
 - #MondayMotivation
 - ゴルフマッチプレー対決
 - チェン
 - Dear D
 - ペニス認証
 - Whitty

I cannot possibly understand why the japs are so much on top of this
Also, hashtags dont seem to necessarily start with a #

The location should be stored in a db
location = {
  id = woe id
  value = location name
}

run = {
  id = auto_increment()
  Location = location.id
  time = datetime.now()
}

trend = {
  id = auto_increment()
  Run = run.id
  value = #hashtag value
  place = number in line, 1 for most popular, 2 for second most popular ...
}
